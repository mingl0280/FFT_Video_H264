# H.264 Video FFT Noise adder

This tool is used to add a high-frequency FFT noise to any video input.

## Requirements
I only tested this on Python 3.10, but for Python 3.8 it should also work.

## How to use this tool
### 1. Create a python venv.
```shell
python3 -m venv <current_path_absolute>
cd venv/Scripts
```
Then run `activate.bat` for Windows or `./activate` for Linux. 

### 2. Install required packages:
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install cupy for your CUDA version.
Please check your CUDA version based on the following instructions:

1. Windows:

Go to "Settings->Apps" and search for "cuda".

2. Linux:

```shell
nvcc --version
```

#### Install cupy

Go to [CuPy Install Guide](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/latest/install.html) and check which version you need to install. 

Do not use the "pip install" command.

```shell
python -m pip install <cupy version you want>
```

### Run the script.
```shell
python main.py -i <input_file_path> -o <output_file_path>
```

> Note: input file must be in H.264 format. 
> 
> No audio will be processed, so you need to manually remix the audio later.
> 
> Please check [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to see how to do that.

## Other stuff
Thanks for [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat?model=gpt-4) GPT-4 model for generating the code. 

I'm not familiar with Python and this is almost completely generated by it. 

Apparently there are still some optimizations needs to be done, please give out advise in issues.
